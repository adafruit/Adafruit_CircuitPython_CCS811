# Travis CI configuration for automated .mpy file generation.
# Author: Tony DiCola
# License: Public Domain
# This configuration will work with Travis CI (travis-ci.org) to automacially
# build .mpy files for MicroPython when a new tagged release is created.  This
# file is relatively generic and can be shared across multiple repositories by
# following these steps:
#   1. Copy this file into a .travis.yml file in the root of the repository.
#   2. Change the deploy > file section below to list each of the .mpy files
#      that should be generated.  The config will automatically look for
#      .py files with the same name as the source for generating the .mpy files.
#      Note that the .mpy extension should be lower case!
#   3. Commit the .travis.yml file and push it to GitHub.
#   4. Go to travis-ci.org and find the repository (it needs to be setup to access
#      your github account, and your github account needs access to write to the
#      repo).  Flip the 'ON' switch on for Travis and the repo, see the Travis
#      docs for more details: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/
#   5. Get a GitHub 'personal access token' which has at least 'public_repo' or
#      'repo' scope: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/
#      Keep this token safe and secure!  Anyone with the token will be able to
#      access and write to your GitHub repositories.  Travis will use the token
#      to attach the .mpy files to the release.
#   6. In the Travis CI settings for the repository that was enabled find the
#      environment variable editing page: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings
#      Add an environment variable named GITHUB_TOKEN and set it to the value
#      of the GitHub personal access token above.  Keep 'Display value in build
#      log' flipped off.
#   7. That's it!  Tag a release and Travis should go to work to add .mpy files
#      to the release.  It takes about a 2-3 minutes for a worker to spin up,
#      build mpy-cross, and add the binaries to the release.
